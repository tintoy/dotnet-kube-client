# KubeClient.Http

## Introduction

`KubeClient.Http` is a port of [HTTPlease](https://github.com/tintoy/HTTPlease), the HTTP client library that dotnet-kube-client was originally built on top of.
A subset of HTTPlease functionality has now been folded into dotnet-kube-client so that consumers no longer need to reference HTTPlease or its dependencies.
